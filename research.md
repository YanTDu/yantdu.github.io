## Research Experience
- **Online Optimization of Neural Network Controls for Stochastic Differential Equations** (2024)
  - **Role:** MSc student under the supervision of Prof. Justin Sirignano
  - **Description:** High-dimensional stochastic optimal control is computationally challenging. The optimal control satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is not computationally tractable to solve in high dimensions (e.g., if the SDE is more than three-dimensional). This project will implement a new online optimization method for training neural network controls for SDEs which is computationally tractable in high dimensions. The trained neural network control will be compared against alternative methods. In low dimensions (three and four dimensions), the trained neural network control will be compared against the optimal control which will be evaluated using finite-difference methods to solve the HJB partial differential equation.
